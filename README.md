# Natural Language Processing Tasks

## 1. Zero-Shot Classification
Zero-shot classification is a technique where a model can classify data into previously unseen labels during training. For example, if the model is trained on categories like "sports" and "politics," it can classify new text into the category "arts" without specific training. This is useful when labeled data is unavailable or hard to gather, as the model uses language understanding to interpret context and choose the most appropriate label.

## 2. Text Generation
Text generation involves using models to produce coherent and contextually relevant text based on a prompt or initial sentence. Applications include creative writing, content generation, and chatbots. Models like GPT-2 and GPT-3 from OpenAI are popular for this task, capable of generating lengthy paragraphs with minimal input.

## 3. Fill Mask
Fill-mask is a technique where a model predicts missing words or phrases in a sentence. The sentence is typically provided with one or more words replaced by a token `<mask>`, and the model attempts to fill in the gaps. This is useful for understanding context in sentences and can be applied in various areas, including sentence correction and text enrichment.

## 4. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Named Entity Recognition is the process of identifying and classifying entities in text, which can include names of people, organizations, locations, dates, and more. NER is essential in natural language processing as it aids in information extraction and content understanding. For example, in the sentence "Barack Obama was born in Hawaii," NER would identify "Barack Obama" as a person and "Hawaii" as a location.

## 5. Question Answering
Question answering is the ability of a model to provide answers to questions based on specific context or text. This is often used in automated question-answering systems, where users can ask questions and receive direct answers from relevant documents. Models like BERT have been trained on question-answering datasets, enabling them to capture important information within context.

## 6. Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is a technique used to determine the attitude or feeling of the writer toward a topic within a text. Sentiments can be positive, negative, or neutral. For instance, in product review analysis, models can help companies understand whether their customers are satisfied. This technique is frequently used in social media analysis and surveys to gauge public opinion.

## 7. Summarization
Summarization is the process of condensing lengthy text into a shorter version while retaining the main information and meaning. There are two approaches: extractive (selecting important sentences from the text) and abstractive (generating a new summary with different sentences). This is particularly useful in report generation, article writing, or information management within organizations.

## 8. Translation
Translation is the task of converting text from one language to another. Neural network-based translation models, such as seq2seq models, have significantly advanced translation quality. This enables applications like Google Translate to provide more accurate and natural translations. Automated translation is crucial in international communication and the development of multilingual content.
